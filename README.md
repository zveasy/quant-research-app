# 📊 AI-Powered Universe Scout & Quant Research Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end pipeline for discovering, enriching, and ranking financial assets using quantitative factors and an AI agent. It features a multi-tab Dash web application for visualizing both factor analysis and the AI-driven asset screening results.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Pipeline**: A command-line script (`create_db.py`) that runs the entire data workflow.
- **Factor Library**: A modular system for calculating quantitative factors like Value (Price-to-Book), Momentum, and Dividend Yield.
- **AI Asset Scoring**: Uses an AI agent (in developer mode) to provide a "Fit Score" and rationale for each asset's suitability.
- **Supply Chain Explorer**: Suggests supplier stocks for major tech companies like Nvidia or Apple.
- **Data Lake Storage**: Saves enriched asset data to fast Parquet files and logs metadata in a DuckDB database for quick queries.
- **SEC Filing Summaries**: Fetches the latest filings and uses GPT-4o to summarize risks.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A multi-tab Dash application for:
    1.  **PCA Factor Analysis**: Visualize latent factors across a basket of stocks.
    2.  **Equities Scout**: Review the AI-scored equity candidates.
    3.  **Currencies**: Screen currency pairs with FX carry metrics.
    4.  **Carbon Credits**: Explore carbon credit opportunities.
    5.  **Green Bonds**: Browse green bond issuances with duration info.
- **CI/CD Ready**: Includes a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run tests on every push, ensuring code quality and stability.
- **Legislation Insights**: Fetches recent bills and uses GPT-4o to summarize potential market impact.
- **Fed Rate Tracking**: Pulls the latest Federal Funds Rate from FRED and records monthly changes to gauge borrowing conditions.
- **Option Pricing Model**: Provides a Black-Scholes implementation for pricing European call and put options.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Setup Environment

First, create and activate a Python virtual environment.

```bash
# Create the environment
python3.11 -m venv .venv

# Activate it (macOS/Linux)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate it (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install Dependencies
Install all required packages from the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root by copying the example file.

cp .env.example .env

Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key.  You can also change
`DB_PATH` if you want the DuckDB file stored somewhere else.

⚙️ How to Use
There are two main parts to this project: running the data pipeline and viewing the dashboard.

1. Run the Data Pipeline
Run `create_db.py` to discover, enrich, and score the assets. The
database will be written to the location specified by `DB_PATH` (or
`./asset_universe.duckdb` by default) for the dashboard to read.

python create_db.py

2. Launch the Dashboard
To view the results in the interactive web application, run the app.py script.

python dash_app/app.py

The dashboard will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8050.

3. Run the Tests
To verify that all components are working as expected, run the pytest suite.

# This command will automatically discover and run all tests
PYTHONPATH=$(pwd) pytest
